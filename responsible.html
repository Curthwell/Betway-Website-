    <p class="solid">The National Responsible Gambling Programme (NRGP) is a resource that integrates research and monitoring, treatment and counselling, public education and awareness, as well as industry training. It is still the only programme of its kind in the world that is jointly controlled by a public/private sector partnership which involves government regulators and the industry.<br>

        <br> The NRGP is managed by the SA Responsible Gambling Foundation (SARGF) which comprises a Board of Directors who represents regulators and the industry. The SARGF reports to the SA Council on Responsible Gambling (SACREG), established by the National Gambling Board and a public/private sector partnership. There is a high degree of accountability and transparency in terms of financial management. Reports on the activities of the programme are published regularly.<br>

      <br>NATIONAL RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING PROGRAMME<br>

    <br>The South African Responsible Gambling Foundation (SARGF) is the entity which supervises the National Responsible Gambling Programme (NRGP) in co-operation with the gambling industry operators and governmental regulators.

    The NRGP is a public-private sector initiative. It was founded in June 2000 and is acknowledged internationally to be exceptionally cost-effective and among the most comprehensive in the world.

    The NRGP integrates education, research and treatment into one programme. It is studied by legislators, regulators and academics from international jurisdictions as an example of successful practice.

    This high degree of national and international recognition reflects well on a country which is leading the way in addressing the critical social issues which have arisen as a result of legalising gambling in 1996.
